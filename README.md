Deep Learning: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from large amounts of data and process data in a way inspired by the human brain. Deep learning models can recognize patterns in text, pictures, sounds, and other data to make predictions and insights.

CNN: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a deep learning model that learns directly from data. CNNs are a type of artificial neural network that are commonly used in computer vision.
